# Project Title

A simple mocked up set of microservices, using Moleculer - a Progressive microservices framework for Node.js.

## Mocked up, you say?

Yeah, all these services are just mocks - It's just a playground to much about with Microservice architecture.
For example, our user service would normally be interacting with a database, here I've just hard coded some dummy users ðŸ˜‚

I've created 3 mock microservices, one for handling users, one for sending emails, and one for auth. Play with them

## To get started

NPM install

then

node index

to run.
